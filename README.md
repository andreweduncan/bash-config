# bash-config

A minimal, opinionated bash configuration for macOS. Provides a clean prompt, useful shell functions, and a one-shot setup script.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andreweduncan/bash-config.git
bash bash-config/setup/setup.sh
# Restart your terminal (or: source ~/.bash_profile)
```

Clone anywhere you like — `setup.sh` detects its own location automatically.

`setup.sh` is idempotent — safe to run again after pulling updates.

## What setup.sh does

1. Sets bash as the default shell (if not already)
2. Installs [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) (if not already)
3. Installs: `git`, `gh`, `python`, `duckdb`, `fzf`, `jq`, `ripgrep`, Google Chrome, VS Code (`code`)
4. Adds source lines to `~/.bashrc` and `~/.bash_profile` pointing to this repo

## Commands

### `sb` — Sandbox

Instantly spins up a temporary scratch directory for low-friction prototyping. Sandboxes live in `$TMPDIR/sandbox/`, which macOS clears on restart — so you get a clean workspace with zero manual cleanup. If something turns out to be worth keeping, use `harden` to permanently move it to `~/projects/`.

Opens the new directory in VS Code and `cd`s into it. Uses a random two-word name by default.

```bash
sb                        # Create sandbox with random name
sb -n my-experiment       # Create sandbox with a specific name
sb -f notes.md            # Create sandbox and open a specific file
sb -d                     # Navigate to the sandbox parent directory
sb -c                     # Interactive cleanup of unused sandboxes
```

Each sandbox gets a `.sbconfig` metadata file and a `scratchpad.txt` to start from.

### `harden` — Promote sandbox to project

Moves a sandbox directory from `$TMPDIR/sandbox/` into `~/projects/`. Prompts for a meaningful name if the sandbox still has a random one.

```bash
harden                    # Harden current directory
harden /path/to/sandbox   # Harden a specific directory
harden -o                 # Harden and open in VS Code
```

### `gld` — Get Last Download

Moves the most recently modified item from `~/Downloads/` to the current directory.

```bash
gld                       # Move with original name
gld my-file               # Move and rename (extension preserved for files)
```

### `rr` — Refresh and Rerun

Sources your bash config to pick up any changes, then reruns a command from history.

```bash
rr                        # Rerun last command
rr git                    # Find most recent command containing 'git', confirm, then run
```

### `src` — Source config

Re-sources `~/.bashrc` and `~/.bash_profile` to pick up changes without restarting the terminal.

```bash
src
```

### Navigation aliases

| `d`   | `cd ~/Desktop` |
| `p`   | `cd ~/projects && ls` |
